HackerRank + Cracking The Coding Interview Programming Solutions

I am writing down sample code in the book in python, writing my own versions of solutions, and answering questions in attempts to understand the material for the book Cracking The Coding Interview (2015).

I am also uploading some of my HackerRank solutions to here. Here's my profile: https://www.hackerrank.com/paulan94
